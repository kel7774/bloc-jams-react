#### Bloc Jams


A Spotify clone project assigned to me when I completed the Bloc.io apprenticeship in June 2018.


Since I completed this project in 2018, React has vastly changed by moving more towards functional componenents with the use of hooks. As a challenge to myself, I have made it a personal goal to refactor this project from its original structure by using React's updates.
